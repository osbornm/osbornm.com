        <h3>NuGet: Add Reference | Awesome</h3>
        <p>
            There’s an Open Source package manager for .NET available now called NuGet. It’s supported 
            and shipping with ASP.NET MVC 3, but it’s not just for ASP.NET. In fact, it’s not just for 
            open source. Join Matthew as we learn all about NuGet, from the basics of consuming packages, 
            to creating and distributing your own packages both internally on your own server and 
            externally on NuGet.org. Then we’ll learn some advanced techniques like preinstalling NuGet 
            packages into your own project templates and how NuGet can be extended and enhanced to write 
            your code for you. We’ll see how using NuGet with your project makes development fun again!

        <h3>Leveraging the ASP.NET frameworks: Choosing the right pieces</h3>
        <p>
            Trying to decide on what ASP.NET framework (ASP.NET MVC, Web Forms, Web Pages) is right for 
            your new project, or maybe you already have an existing investment in one of the ASP.NET 
            frameworks and feel that you can use the others? The good news is that the different 
            frameworks all snap and fit snuggly together just like your favorite childhood building 
            blocks. We’ll look at how you can benefit from mixing and matching these pieces for the 
            different parts of your project.  Come learn how easy it is to choose the right framework 
            for the right job and make them all seamlessly fit together.
